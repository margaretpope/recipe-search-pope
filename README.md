# Calling All Foodies
Calling All Foodies utilized the MVC model to collect and store user data in MySQL tables, as well as make calls to an external API. Users can create an account so that they can track their favorite restaurants, where they're located, and what the occassion was. Users can also search for new recipes to try.
